# Front End web app development 101

I could easily be labelled as a “[Ruby on] Rails Developer” and I’m quite content with the asset pipeline for managing various front-end web development assets (Javascript, CSS, client side templates, images, fonts, etc). But since I’m playing around with [Go](http://golang.org/) for back end development on my current project, I thought I’d investigate current practices for managing assets on the front end. This is a rambling log of what I learned while I was playing around.

You can read all about it over at [Notes from a Messy Desk](http://woss.name). Start with [part 1](http://woss.name/articles/front-end-development-101-part-1/).
